Limitation to get real Data
Can’t run without internet access

Create a quiz war between all the users. Generate a ranking list.
Make a challenge for earning score.



### Conclusion:
The main purpose of our project is to develop an application that offers new aspects of learning and improving knowledge in educational area. Most of the available apps are entertainment-based, which mostly do not contribute to the academic enhancement of the students. The theme of our BPCS QUIZ app is to provide user to practice for subjective tests conducted on national level, so in this app we focus on BCS Preliminary examination. This BPCS QUIZ app is useful for the preparation of BCS Preliminary test. These functions can be used only once by a user.
